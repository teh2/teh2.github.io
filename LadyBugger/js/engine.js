/* Engine.js
 * This file provides the game loop functionality (update entities and render),
 * draws the initial game board on the screen, and then calls the update and
 * render methods on your player and enemy objects (defined in your app.js).
 *
 * A game engine works by drawing the entire game screen over and over, kind of
 * like a flipbook you may have created as a kid. When your player moves across
 * the screen, it may look like just that image/character is moving or being
 * drawn but that is not the case. What's really happening is the entire "scene"
 * is being drawn over and over, presenting the illusion of animation.
 *
 * All of your app's interactions with the engine come in one of three forms.
 * 1) The engine has pre-defined points where you can call functions in your objects.
 *    these are defined in the functions below who's names look like xxxEntities.
 * 2) Resources.load() contains an array pointing to each of the resources (images)
 *    that you want the engine to pre-load for you before it starts up your game.
 * 3) The engine makes specific functions available to your app through the
 *    'theEngine' variable. For example, your app can pause, unpause, or reset the
 *    game engine, based upon conditions in the game itself.
